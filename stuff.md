# What is a DevOps?

- The term (development and operations) is an extensions of agile develpment environments that aims to enhence the process of software delivery as a whole.

- DevOps (Development and operations) engineers working together, following Lean and Agile principles. Delivering software in a rapid and continuous manner.

DevOps is not:
- A simply combining development and operations.
- A separated team
- A tool.
- Just automation.

## What is the goal?

There are three pillars:
    - DevOps         -> For speed and agility.
    - Microservices  -> For small deployments.
    - Containers     -> For ephemeral runtimes.


Culture is the #1 success factor in DevOps. Building a culture of *shared responsability, transparency and faster feedback* is the fundation of every high-performing DevOps team --Atlassian--.

To become a DevOps, it is necessary to change the company culture. It must to change:
    - the way people think.
    - the way people work.
    - the way people are organized.
    - the way people are measured.


Waterfall > Agile > DevOps are methods for software development and delivery.
Monoliths > SOA > Microservices are architecture: ways that software is build.
Physical sevices > VMS > Containers are used to create infrastructure: basic services such as communication and storage.
