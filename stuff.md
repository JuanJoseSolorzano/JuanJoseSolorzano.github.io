# Overview Of DevOps

## What is a DevOps?

- The term (development and operations) is an extensions of agile develpment environments that aims to enhence the process of software delivery as a whole.

- DevOps (Development and operations) engineers working together, following Lean and Agile principles. Delivering software in a rapid and continuous manner.

DevOps is not:
- A simply combining development and operations.
- A separated team
- A tool.
- Just automation.

## What is the goal?

There are three pillars:
    - DevOps         -> For speed and agility.
    - Microservices  -> For small deployments.
    - Containers     -> For ephemeral runtimes.


Culture is the #1 success factor in DevOps. Building a culture of *shared responsability, transparency and faster feedback* is the fundation of every high-performing DevOps team --Atlassian--.

To become a DevOps, it is necessary to change the company culture. It must to change:
    - the way people think.
    - the way people work.
    - the way people are organized.
    - the way people are measured.

## Agile perspective.
Waterfall > Agile > DevOps are methods for software development and delivery.
Monoliths > SOA > Microservices are architecture: ways that software is build.
Physical sevices > VMS > Containers are used to create infrastructure: basic services such as communication and storage.

# Thinking DevOps

## Code reuse dilemma:
    - Code has 80% of what you need but 20% is missing

## Social coding solution:
    - Discuss with the repo **owner**.
    - Agree to develop it.
    - Open an **Issue** and assign it to yourself.
    - **Fork** the code and make your changes.
    - Issue a **Pull Request** to review and merge back.

## Git Repository Guidelines
    - The same that we already know about it.

## The size of the Batches
    Working in small batches means devlivering something useful quickly.
    Using singe piece flow leads to faster feedback loops

## Minimal Viable Product (VMP):
    - MVP is a tool for learning.
    - The experiment may fail and taht's okay.
    - Is the minimal thing that you can do to teset your hypothesis.

## Quiz
    - Which of these is typical of traditional thinkning?
        ANS: Rebuilding 100% of teh code to get the 20% change you need.
    - Which of these is part of minimum viable product?
        ANS: Should I pivot or perservere?

## Test Driven Development (TDD)
    - Test your code, but first create cases and then create code.
    - Red->Green->Refractor cycle. 
    It is important: It saves time whe developing, you can code faster and with more confidence, It ensures the code is working as expected. It ensuere that future changes do not break you code, In order to create a DevOps CI/CD pipeline , all testing must be automated

## Behavior driven development (BDD)
    - BDD focuses on the behavior of the system from the outside in. It looks at the sysstem as a consumer of it.
    - BDD uses an approachable syntax that everyone can understand.
    - It improves the communication.

## Cloud Native Microservices (CNM)
    - CNM is acollection of independintly deplyable microservices.
    - Stateless microservices each maintain their own state in a separate database or persistent object store.
    - Microservices are loosly coupled services, designed for scalability and communication with APIs.

# Working DevOps
    - Culture of teaming and collaboration.
    - Agil development as a shared discipline.
    - Push smaller releases faster

## Taylorism
    - Is regarding the Industrial revolution. It describes how to work as autmotive line assembly, working in silos.
    _Software development is bespoke:_
        - Sofwarare development is NOT like assebling automobiiles.
        - Most of the parts do not exist yet.
        - Software develpment is craft work.

    - Command and control is not Agile.
    - Stop working in silos
    - Let your people amaze you.

    - Working DevOps means pushing small releases faster in order to get feedback , minimize risk, and maximize learning.
    - Taylorims was designed for factory work, while software development is like craft work.

# Software Engineering vs civil engineering
    - SW stak is constantly updated.
    - 
# Required DevOps behavior.
    - DevOps delivers a continual series of small changes.
    - Development wants innovation and Operation wants stability. But you cannot get both.
    
## Required DevOps behaviors
    - Shared ownership and high collaboration.
    - Risk managment by embracing change.
    - Ephemeral infrastructure as code.
    - Automated self-service.
    - Feedback loops and data-driven responsability.

## Infrestructre as code
    - Described an executable textual format.
    - Configure using that description.
    - Configure the system .
    - Never perform configurations manually.
    - Use version control.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Delevery.
    - CI/CD is not one thing.
    - Continuous Integration is: Continuously building, testing, and merging to master.
    - Continuous Delivery is: Continuosly deploying to a production-like environment.

# Align teams with the business
    - Each team has its own mission aligned with the business.
    - Teams have end-to-end responsibility for what they build.
    - Teams should have a long term mission.

## There is no DevOps Teams.
    - DevOps is the jpractice of development and operations engineers working together during the intire software lifecycle, following Lean and Agile principles that allow them to deliver high-qualitiy results.
